Remove cards not suitable for the player count (indicated on the cards). For Age III, shuffle the purple Guild cards and randomly include a number equal to the number of players plus two; return the rest to the box.\n\n**Starting Resources**: Each player receives 3 coins, placing them on their Wonder board.

The seventh card is discarded without effect.\n\n**Military Conflict Resolution**: At the end of each age, compare the number of shield symbols (military strength) with neighboring players:\n   - **Victory**: Gain a victory token worth 1 point (Age I), 3 points (Age II), or 5 points (Age III) if you have more shields than a neighbor.\n   - **Defeat**: Receive a -1 point token if you have fewer shields than a neighbor.\n",

The first player selects one Wonder, the second player chooses two, and the first player takes the remaining one.

Remove three random cards from both the Age I and Age II decks without revealing them. Shuffle the Guild cards and add three randomly to the Age III deck. Return the unused Guild cards to the box.\n\n**Card Layout**: For Age I, arrange the cards in a specific face-up and face-down pattern as shown in the rulebook. This formation dictates which cards are accessible based on their exposure.\n\n**Coins**: Each player starts with 7 coins from the bank.\n\n**Military Tokens**: Place the appropriate Military tokens on the board's designated spaces.\r",

A card is accessible if it's not covered by another card.\n\n**Action Choices**: Upon selecting a card, you can:\n   - **Construct the Building**: Pay the resource cost (either through your own production or by purchasing from the bank) and place the card in your city.\n   - **Discard for Coins**: Remove the card from play to gain 2 coins plus an additional coin for each yellow commercial building in your city.\n   - **Construct a Wonder**: Use the card to build one of your Wonders by paying its cost and placing the card beneath the Wonder, activating its effect. Note: Only seven Wonders can be built in total; the eighth remains unconstructed.\n\n**Resource Management**: If you lack necessary resources, you can buy them from the bank. The cost is 2 coins plus 1 coin for each corresponding resource symbol your opponent produces.\n\n**Military and Science Advances**:\n   - **Military**: Red cards move the Conflict pawn toward your opponent's capital based on the number of shields. Reaching the opponent's capital results in an immediate military victory.\n   - **Science**: Green cards with scientific symbols. Collecting six different symbols grants an immediate scientific victory.\n\n**Age Transition**: The Age ends when all cards have been drafted. Prepare the next Age by setting up its specific card layout.\n\n**Game End**: The game concludes if a player achieves military or scientific supremacy. If neither occurs by the end of Age III, tally victory points from your buildings, Wonders, coins, and other effects to determine the winner.\n",
